This server allows executing terminal commands, managing processes, and file operations. It's built on top of the MCP Filesystem Server. Features include executing commands with output streaming, process management, and code editing with search/replace blocks. That's definitely a top contender.\n\nSearch result [2] is a blog post about setting up MCP servers in WSL for Claude Desktop. It mentions using Cline to create a word counter tool and configuring the Claude config file. However, this seems more about the setup process rather than listing specific servers. The example given is a word counter tool, which might be a custom server, but not necessarily one of the top 20.\n\nSearch result [3] is the official MCP documentation, which includes a tutorial for building a weather server. The example server here provides tools for getting weather alerts and forecasts. This is another example of a custom server, but again, it's more about how to build one rather than listing existing ones.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the top 20 MCP servers, but the search results don't provide a list. The first result is a specific server (ClaudeComputerCommander), the second is a setup guide, and the third is a tutorial. There's no mention of other servers in the provided results. \n\nHmm, maybe the user expects me to infer from the available information. The ClaudeComputerCommander from [1] is a significant one. The weather server from [3] is another example. The blog in [2] mentions using the server-filesystem and server-sequential-thinking, which are part of the MCP SDK examples. So perhaps those are standard servers provided by the MCP team.\n\nBut the search results don't list 20 servers. The user might be under the impression that there's a list, but based on the provided data, only a few are mentioned. I need to clarify that the available information doesn't include a top 20 list but highlights some key servers. \n\nI should structure the answer by mentioning the ClaudeComputerCommander as a primary example, then note the MCP SDK's example servers like the weather server, filesystem server, and sequential-thinking server.

2025-02-26T03:40:12.182Z [perplexity] [info] Message from server: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":32,"result":{"result":"Search results for: \"top 20 MCP servers for Claude desktop app\" using model: sonar-reasoning\n\n<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the top 20 MCP servers for the Claude desktop app. Let me start by looking through the provided search results to see what's available.\n\nFirst, in search result [1], there's a GitHub repository for ClaudeComputerCommander. This server allows executing terminal commands, managing processes, and file operations. It's built on top of the MCP Filesystem Server. Features include executing commands with output streaming, process management, and code editing with search/replace blocks. That's definitely a top contender.\n\nSearch result [2] is a blog post about setting up MCP servers in WSL for Claude Desktop. It mentions using Cline to create a word counter tool and configuring the Claude config file. However, this seems more about the setup process rather than listing specific servers. The example given is a word counter tool, which might be a custom server, but not necessarily one of the top 20.\n\nSearch result [3] is the official MCP documentation, which includes a tutorial for building a weather server. The example server here provides tools for getting weather alerts and forecasts. This is another example of a custom server, but again, it's more about how to build one rather than listing existing ones.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the top 20 MCP servers, but the search results don't provide a list. The first result is a specific server (ClaudeComputerCommander), the second is a setup guide, and the third is a tutorial. There's no mention of other servers in the provided results. \n\nHmm, maybe the user expects me to infer from the available information. The ClaudeComputerCommander from [1] is a significant one. The weather server from [3] is another example. The blog in [2] mentions using the server-filesystem and server-sequential-thinking, which are part of the MCP SDK examples. So perhaps those are standard servers provided by the MCP team.\n\nBut the search results don't list 20 servers. The user might be under the impression that there's a list, but based on the provided data, only a few are mentioned. I need to clarify that the available information doesn't include a top 20 list but highlights some key servers. \n\nI should structure the answer by mentioning the ClaudeComputerCommander as a primary example, then note the MCP SDK's example servers like the weather server, filesystem server, and sequential-thinking server. Also, mention that the blog post in [2] discusses setting up custom servers, indicating that users can create their own.

The configuration involves editing a JSON file with server details and commands, ensuring Node.js is installed, and restarting the app. Troubleshooting involves checking logs and server commands if issues arise.\n\nI need to structure this information clearly. Start with a definition of MCP servers, their purpose, supported models, configuration steps, use cases, and troubleshooting. Use headers for sections, bullet points for lists, and a table to compare Haiku and Sonnet. Make sure to cite the sources appropriately after each relevant point.\n</think>\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are extensions that enhance the capabilities of the **Claude Desktop App** by enabling integration with external services and local resources. These servers allow Claude to interact with file systems, databases, APIs, and other tools, enabling advanced workflows and data-driven interactions[1][3].\n\n## Key Features and Functionality  \n- **Integration Capabilities**: MCP servers connect Claude to local file systems, GitHub repositories, spreadsheets (via GRID API), databases, and third-party APIs[1][2][3].  \n- **Supported Models**: Both **Claude Haiku** and **Claude Sonnet** support MCP server integration, with Sonnet offering enhanced performance for complex workflows[1].  \n- **Configuration**: Requires editing the `claude_desktop_config.json` file to specify server details (e.g., host, port, integrations like GitHub tokens or database credentials)[1][3].  \n\n## Setup and Configuration  \n1. **Update the Config File**:  \n   ```json\n   \"mcp_server\": {\n     \"host\": \"localhost\",\n     \"port\": 8080,\n     \"integrations\": {\n       \"github\": {\n         \"token\": \"your_github_token\"\n       },\n       \"database\": {\n         \"type\": \"postgresql\",\n         \"credentials\": {\n           \"user\": \"db_user\",\n           \"password\": \"db_password\"\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```  \n   Example configuration for GitHub and database access[1].  \n\n2. **Node.js Dependency**:  \n   - Install Node.js to run MCP server commands like `npx` for filesystem access[3].  \n   - Clone repositories (e.g., `claude-mcp` for GRID API integration) and configure paths in the JSON file[2].  \n\n## Use Cases  \n- **File System Operations**: Read/write files, search directories, and organize data (e.g., moving images to a new folder)[3].  \n- **Spreadsheet Interaction**: Query, update cells, and evaluate formulas using GRID’s API[2].  \n- **GitHub Collaboration**: Automate code deployments and repository management[1].  \n\n| Feature               | Claude Haiku       | Claude Sonnet      |  \n|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|  \n| **MCP Support**       | Supported          | Supported          |  \n| **Workflow Automation**| Efficient          | Optimized for Complexity |  \n| **Performance**        | Consistent         | Superior in High-Demand Scenarios |  \n\n## Troubleshooting  \n- **Connection Issues**: Verify server status, firewall settings, and correct host/port in the config file[1][3].  \n- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure tokens/credentials are valid and permissions are granted[1][2].  \n- **Timeouts**: Optimize server resources or implement retry mechanisms[1].  \n\nMCP servers transform Claude into a versatile tool for data-driven tasks, bridging AI capabilities with external systems for dynamic, context-aware interactions[1][2][3]."}}
